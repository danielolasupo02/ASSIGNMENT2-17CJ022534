Breakdown of How I accomplished the project

+I made use of Scalable vector graphics to generate the Nigerian map

+I made of HTML & CSS for styling each of the portions on the map for the 36 different states including FCT 

+I made use of this link to get precise style colors for the 36 states including FCT:
https://www.computerhope.com/htmcolor.htm


+I made use of matplotlib to graph the pie chart using the assigned IGR-2018 statistics


        Matplotlib code I used:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#IGR 2018 on Y-axis
Y = [3381405773.46,3595598485.61,3030430890.30,4827469298.12,14834904447.49]
#IGR 2018 Quarters
X = ['Q1','Q2','Q3','Q4','Full Year']
#Sets a title for the pie chart
plt.title('IGR 2018 Pie chart Statistics for Abia State')
#Plots the pie chart
plt.pie(Y,labels=X)
#Displays the pie chart figure
plt.show()

This is for Abia state Plot
